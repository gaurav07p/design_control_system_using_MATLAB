Simulating Back-EMF Voltage:
Create a simple model to simulate the back-EMF profile of a three-phase BLDC motor.
In Simulink, set up a scenario where the motor shaft is turned while all three phases have open terminals.
Measure the voltage produced at one of the phases to observe the back-EMF.

Modeling a Three-Phase Inverter:
Build a model to convert DC power to three-phase currents for controlling a BLDC motor.
Drive the motor by energizing the coil pairs using the inverter model.
Focus on the control algorithm, including the three-phase inverter and commutation logic.
